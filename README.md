## 🧩 Modular System Architecture

* *Flask (Backend)*: Processes API calls, handles logic, and manages database operations.
* *Django (Frontend)*: Consumes Flask APIs and renders data-driven, responsive UI components.
* Clear separation of concerns leads to high *maintainability, **testability, and **scalability*.

## 🔗 API Communication

* REST APIs developed in *Flask* serve as the system’s communication backbone.
* Supported HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
* Sample API Endpoints:

  * /api/orders
  * /api/inventory
  * /api/warehouse
  * /api/users

✅ *All endpoints tested rigorously using POSTMAN*:

* Response format validation
* Error handling
* Security headers & role validations

---

## ⚙ System Workflow

1. User accesses web interface built with Django.
2. Django makes real-time HTTP calls to Flask APIs.
3. Flask processes requests and interacts with the database.
4. Response is sent back and dynamically rendered on the frontend.

> 🔁 This continuous feedback loop keeps data in sync and the user experience smooth.

---

## 🧪 Testing & QA

* *POSTMAN* used extensively to validate all API endpoints.
* Manual UI/UX testing on the Django side.
* Unit testing modules in progress for key Flask functions.

---

## 🌱 Planned Enhancements

* Multi-language support for global audiences.
* Role-based dashboards with real-time KPIs.
* Integrated chat support for customer service.
* Scheduled email reports and alerts.
