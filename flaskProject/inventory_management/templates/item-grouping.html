        <h1>Item Grouping and Bundling</h1>
        <p>Item Grouping and Bundling is an advanced feature designed to enhance the way you manage your inventory.
            This feature allows you to categorize and combine items with similar attributes into groups and bundles,
            making it easier to track stock, customize offers, and improve sales efficiency. Whether you're in retail, 
            e-commerce, or wholesale, this functionality will streamline your operations and help you get the most out of
            your inventory.</p>

                <h3>Why Item Grouping and Bundling?</h3>
                <p>Grouping items by category or common features can simplify your workflow by allowing you to monitor stock 
                    levels, identify trends, and manage orders more efficiently. Bundling items together creates tailored packages 
                    that cater to customer needs and encourage bulk purchases, leading to higher sales.</p>
                
                <p>For instance, if you are selling electronics, you could group products like chargers, earphones, and power banks 
                    together for easier stock management. Bundling them into promotional packages (e.g., “Complete Mobile Accessory Kit”) 
                    can boost your sales during special offers.</p>

                <h3>How It Works</h3>
                <p>The process of item grouping and bundling involves selecting products and categorizing them based on common
                    attributes like size, color, or type. Once grouped, you can create bundles for customers, offering special 
                    prices or promotions for specific combinations of products.</p>

                <p>In your inventory system, once these groupings and bundles are created, you can easily adjust pricing, stock 
                    levels, and product availability based on the bundled or grouped items. This also allows you to track 
                    performance per group and make informed decisions on what bundles are performing best.</p>
